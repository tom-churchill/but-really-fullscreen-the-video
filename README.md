# But really open image in new tab

You know when you right click an image there is the option to "Open image in new tab"? You know how it doesn't work if the image is covered by another hidden element? Wouldn't it be nice if you could just tell it to ignore those elements and just open the dam image hidden underneath. Well good news, that's what this extension does!

Bonus features!
* If there are lots of images stacked on top of each other, it will open all of the images.
* It will even check for images using the CSS background-image property.
* Not only that but it will work on SVGs too!
